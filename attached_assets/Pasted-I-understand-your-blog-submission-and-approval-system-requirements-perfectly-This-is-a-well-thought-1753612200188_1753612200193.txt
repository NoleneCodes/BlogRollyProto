I understand your blog submission and approval system requirements perfectly! This is a well-thought-out content moderation and user tier system. Let me clarify the key components:

System Overview I Understand:
Database Structure:
Main blogs table for general content
Adult content table (18+ only) - separate table with age verification
User age verification from signup forms
Approval workflow with admin dashboard
User Tiers:
Free accounts: Max 3 live posts (from approved posts)
Premium/Pro accounts: Unlimited live posts when approved
Bloggers can toggle which approved posts are live (within their limits)
Admin Workflow:
Dashboard showing all submitted blog URLs
Simple approve/disapprove buttons
Pre-defined disapproval reasons for quick selection
Automated email notifications to bloggers
Email System:
Approval emails with blog details
Rejection emails with specific reasons
Guidance for resubmission or contact options
Questions to Clarify Before We Start:
Age Verification: Should we add an age confirmation field to existing user signup, or do you want a separate age verification step for 18+ content access?

Admin Permissions: Should we use the existing admin role system, or create specific content moderator roles?

Email Priority: Do you want to start with the database structure first, or should we set up the email system (Resend/Mailchimp) alongside it?

Disapproval Reasons: What are the main categories you want for quick rejection (e.g., "Inappropriate content", "Broken link", "Spam", "Off-topic", etc.)?

Blog Status Flow: Should it be: Submitted ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Approved/Rejected ‚Üí Live/Inactive?

Since you want to work on one thing at a time, I suggest we start with either:

Option A: Database schema and tables setup
Option B: Admin dashboard for blog review
Which would you prefer to tackle first?

Age Verification
Decision: Do both

Add an age confirmation field at signup

Add a secondary age-gate step for accessing any 18+ content (if user hasn‚Äôt confirmed yet)

üëÆ Admin Permissions
Decision: Create separate moderator roles for now.
You‚Äôll manage approvals/rejections using the admin dashboard system we have

üìß Email System Priority
Decision: ‚úÖ Start with the database structure first

Set up tables and logic before integrating Resend (transactional emails) or Mailchimp (newsletters/waitlist).

‚ùå Disapproval Reasons
Decision Use quick-reject categories including:

Inappropriate content

Broken link

Spam

Teaser / Paywall site

Malicious site

Not a blog

Duplicate

Ai-Generated /Low quality

Copyright violation

You can store this as an enum or link it to a rejection_reason field and optionally a rejection_note.

üîÅ Blog Status Flow
Decision: ‚úÖ Use this flow:
Submitted ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Approved/Rejected ‚Üí Live/Inactive

Full status enum:

ts
Copy
Edit
'draft' | 'submitted' | 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'live' | 'inactive'
You can toggle live/inactive manually from the approved stage ‚Äî or auto-move to live when approved.

Perfect! I understand your requirements. Let's start with the database structure to support your blog submission and approval system. Since you want to work on one thing at a time, I'll focus on setting up the database schema first.

I'll create the database tables to support:

Age verification at signup + secondary age-gate for 18+ content
Blog submission workflow with status tracking
Admin approval/rejection system with predefined reasons
User tiers (free vs premium) with live post limits
lib/supabase.ts
Now I'll create the SQL migration scripts that you can use to set up these tables in Supabase:

database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
Perfect! I've created a comprehensive database schema that supports all your requirements:

‚úÖ What's Included:
Age Verification System:
Primary age verification at signup (age_verified in user_profiles)
Secondary age-gate for 18+ content (has_confirmed_18_plus)
Separate adult_blog_submissions table for 18+ content
RLS policies that respect age verification
Blog Status Workflow:
Complete status enum: draft ‚Üí submitted ‚Üí pending ‚Üí approved/rejected ‚Üí live/inactive
Automated triggers to track live post counts
Status transition validation helpers
Admin/Moderator System:
Separate roles for admin and moderator
blog_reviews table with predefined rejection reasons
All your requested rejection categories as enum values
User Tier Management:
Free tier: max 3 live posts
Premium/Pro: unlimited live posts
Automatic tier limit tracking with triggers
Users can toggle approved posts live/inactive within limits
Email System Ready:
email_queue table for notifications
Template data structure for approval/rejection emails
Status tracking for email delivery
Next Steps:
Run the migration in your Supabase dashboard
Install @supabase/supabase-js package
Set up your environment variables
Build the admin dashboard for blog review
Would you like me to work on the admin dashboard interface next, or would you prefer to set up Supabase integration first?
