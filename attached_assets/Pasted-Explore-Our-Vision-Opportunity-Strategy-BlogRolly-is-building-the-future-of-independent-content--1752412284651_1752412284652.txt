Explore Our Vision, Opportunity & Strategy
BlogRolly is building the future of independent content discoveryâ€”one that puts power back in the hands of creators.
We believe the next wave of the creator economy wonâ€™t be algorithmic.
It will be owned, authentic, and connectedâ€”just like the early web intended.
Weâ€™re not just rebuilding a tool.
Weâ€™re rebuilding a culture.
BlogRolly is the next-generation blogroll our â€˜Yâ€™ is to become a platform that helps self-hosted bloggers grow, monetise, and build loyal readerships without relying on social feeds or SEO games.
How weâ€™ll win:
    â€¢ By serving the overlooked: 30M+ independent bloggers building businesses from scratch
    â€¢ By reviving lost discovery habits: organic linking, curated ecosystems, value-based visibility
    â€¢ By supporting modern, monetisation-friendly infrastructure for indie writers

Founder Bio â€“ Why Me, Why Now
Hi, Iâ€™m Nolene Dube, the founder of BlogRolly.
As a researcher, and solo builder, Iâ€™ve lived the silence that fell over the open web. Iâ€™ve seen incredible creators publish great contentâ€”only for it to disappear into the void.
I started BlogRolly because I believe in digital sovereignty and the power of long-form thought. I want to make the web feel interconnected again not just performative and feed-based.
With a background in [briefly list highlights, e.g. regulatory systems, content strategy, tech upskilling], Iâ€™ve bootstrapped the MVP with no outside funding and designed a product informed by both cultural insight and user empathy.
Iâ€™m building BlogRolly not to go viral but to last.
