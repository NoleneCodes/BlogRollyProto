        <h2>Founder Bio â€“ Why Me, Why Now</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nolene Dube, the founder of BlogRolly.</p>
        <p>As a researcher, and solo builder, I've lived the silence that fell over the open web. I've seen incredible creators publish great contentâ€”only for it to disappear into the void.</p>
        <p>I started BlogRolly because I believe in digital sovereignty and the power of long-form thought. I want to make the web feel interconnected again not just performative and feed-based.</p>
        <p>With a background in [briefly list highlights, e.g. regulatory systems, content strategy, tech upskilling], I've bootstrapped the MVP with no outside funding and designed a product informed by both cultural insight and user empathy.</p>
        <p><strong>I'm building BlogRolly not to go viral but to last.</strong></p>
